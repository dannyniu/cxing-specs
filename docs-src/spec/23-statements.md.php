<?= hc_H1("Phrases") ?>

Between expressions and statements, there are phrases.

Phrases are like expressions, and have values, but due to grammatical
constraints, they lack the usage flexibility of expressions. For example,
phrases cannot be used as arguments to function calls, since phrases are
not comma-delimited; nor can they be assigned to variables, since assignment
operators binds more tightly than phrase delimiters. On the other hand, phrases
provides flexibility in combining full expressions in way that wouldn't
otherwise be expressive enough through expressions due to use of parentheses.

```
primary-phrase % primaryphrase
: expressions-list % degenerate
| flow-control-phrase % flowctrl
;
```

- `degenerate`: The value of this phrase is that of the expression.
- `flowctrl`: This phrase alters the normal control flow, it has no value.

```
flow-control-phrase % flowctrl
: control-flow-operator % op
| control-flow-operator label % labelledop
| "return" % returnvoid
| "return" expression % returnexpr
;
```

- `op`: Apply the flow-control operation to the inner-most applicable scope.
- `labelledop`: Apply the flow-control operation to the labelled statement scope.
- `returnvoid`: Terminates the executing function.
- `returnexpr`: Terminates the executing function with
  return value being that of `expression`.

```
control-flow-operator: % flowctrlop
: "break" % break
| "continue" % continue
;
```

- `break`: Terminates the applicable loop.
- `continue`: Skip the remainder of the applicable loop body and
  proceed to the next iteration.

```
and-phrase % andphrase
: primary-phrase % degenerate
| and-phrase "and" primary-phrase % conj
;

or-phrase % orphrase
: and-phrase % degenerate
| or-phrase "or" and-phrase % disj
| or-phrase "_Fallback" and-phrase % nullcoalesce
;
```

- `conj`: Refer to `logic-and`.
- `disj`: Refer to `logic-or`.
- `nullcoalesce`: Refer to `postfix-expr`.

<?= hc_H1("Statements") ?>

```
statement % stmt
: ";" % emptystmt
| identifier ":" statement % labelled
| or-phrase ";" % phrase
| conditionals % cond
| while-loop % while
| do-while-loop % dowhile
| for-loop % for
| "{" statements-list "}" % brace
| declaration ";" % decl
;
```

- `emptystmt`: This does nothing in a function body.
- `labelled`: Identifies the statement with a label.
- `brace`: Executes `statements-list`.

<?= hc_H2("Condition Statements") ?>

```
conditionals % condstmt
: predicated-clause % base
| predicated-clause "else" statement % else
;
```

- `else`: Executes `predicated-clause`, if none of its statement(s) were
  executed due to no predicate evaluated to true, then `statement` is executed.

```
predicated-cluase % predclause
: "if" "(" expressions-list ")" statement % base
| predicate-clause "elif" "(" expressions-list ")" statement % genrule
;
```

- `base`: Evaluate `expressions-list` (in expression phrase context as
  mentioned in the <?= hcNamedSection("Compounds") ?>),
  if it's true, then `statement` is executed, otherwise it's not executed.
- `genrule`: Executes `predicate-clause`, if none of its statement(s) were
  executed due to no predicate evaluated to true, then evaluate
  `expressions-list`, if that is still not true, then `statement` is not
  executed, otherwise, `statement` is executed.

<?= hc_H2("Loops") ?>

```
while-loop % while
: "while" "(" expressions-list ")" statement % rule
;
```

- `rule`: To execute `rule`, evaluate `expressions-list`, if it's true,
  then execute `statement` and then `rule`.

```
do-while-loop % dowhile
: "do" "{" statements-list "}" "while" "(" expressions-list ")" ";" % rule
;
```

- `rule`: To execute `rule`, execute `statements-list`, then evaluate
  `expressions-list`, if it's true, then execute `rule`.

```
for-loop % for
: "for" "(" expressions-list ";"
            expressions-list ";"
            expressions-list ")" statement % classic

| "for" "(" declaration ";"
            expressions-list ";"
            expressions-list ")" statement % vardecl
;
```

- `classic`: Evaluate `expressions-list` before the first semicolon, then
  execute the for loop by invoking the "execute the for loop once" recursive
  procedure described later.
- `vardecl`: Evaluate `declaration`, then execute the for loop in a fashion
  similar to `classic`.

To execute the for loop once, evaluate `expressions-list` after the first
semicolon, if it's true, then `statement` is evaluated, then the
`expressions-list` after the second semicolon is evaluated, and the for loop is
executed once again. For the purpose of "proceeding to the next iteration" as
mentioned in `continue`, the `expressions-list` after the second semicolon is
not considered part of the loop body, and is therefore always executed before
proceeding to the next iteration.

The description here used the word "once" to describe the semantic of the loop
in terms of "functional recursion", where "functional" is in the sense of the
"functional programming paradigm".

<?= hc_H2("Statements List") ?>

```
statement-list % stmtlist
: statement ";" % base
| statement-list statement ";" genrule
;
```

- `base`: `statement` is executed, the semicolon is a delimitor.
- `genrule`: `statement-list` is first executed, then `statement` is executed.

<?= hc_H2("Declarations") ?>

Because the value of a variable that held integer value may transition to
`null` after being assigned the result of certain computation, the variable
needs to hold type information, as such, variables are represented conceptually
as "lvalue" native objects. (Actually, just value native objects, as their
scope and key can be deduced from context.)

```
declaration % decl
: "decl" identifier % singledecl
| "decl" identifier "=" assign-expr % signledeclinit
| declaration "," identifier % declarelist1
| declaration "," identifier "=" assign-expr % declarelist2
;
```

- `singledecl`: Declares a variable with the spelling of the identifier as
  its name, and initialize its value to `null`.
- `singledeclinit`: Declares a variable with the spelling of the identifier as
  its name, and initialize its value to that of `assign-expr`.
- `declarelist1`: In addition to what's declared in `declaration`, declare
  another variable in a way similar to `singledecl`.
- `declarelist2`: In addition to what's declared in `declaration`, declare
  another variable in a way similar to `singledeclinit`.
