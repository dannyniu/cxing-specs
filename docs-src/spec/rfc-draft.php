<h1 class="booktitle">Request For Comment on Draft Specification for
The <?= strtoupper($langname) ?> Programming Language.</h1>

<p>
Greetings all. This is a proposed draft of a proposed new programming language.
The BDFL of this project is DannyNiu/NJF. The intention of this request for
comments is to solicit ideas - advice, suggestions for improvement, as well as
critique on preceived defects.
</p>

<p>
While any idea are welcome, they're better received if they're accompanied
with counter-arguments, usage illustrations, and/or sketch of implementation,
yet the decision of adoption is ultimately made by the BDFL of the project.
</p>

<p>
You may submit your idea and/or queries by opening Issues at GitHub or Gitee,
both English and Chinese languages are accepted.
</p>
